        <b>My name is Oluwatoyin Atobatele,</b>
        <i
          >I love technology so much because, I dont know where would the world
          be without it? Well, we would be without all the unreliable pains that
          come with it, such as power-shortages, printer’s not printing, frozen
          computer screens, and viruses. I mean, how did the people survive
          without technology in the olden days? I know I have a blast when I’m
          typing up a paper that’s due the next day and my printer runs out of
          ink, then my fun continues when I’m forced to drive to the store to
          buy some since almost every single teacher now-a-days assumes everyone
          has access and patience for technology. Isn’t it wonderful when your
          computer gets a virus and you have to wait for eternity while your
          computer cleans out this invisible monster you don’t even know how it
          got there? Good times. I don’t know why anyone would ever want to
          write an essay on paper and miss out on all the adventure of Microsoft
          Word. Not to mention, paper kills trees, unlike computers; all they do
          is use up a ton of electricity, it’s not like electricity is made from
          any of our limited natural resources. How about the fact that
          technology in general is so reliable! You buy a computer and it lasts,
          maybe seven years! Phones as well last for a long time, don’t they.
          Oh, well they don’t, but who cares when new phones are created all the
          time because the previous ones were crap: I just always know the new
          phones will be much better than the old ones. My next point about how
          I love it! Some people prefer to spend their time outdoors, in the
          sun, getting in touch with themselves. Ha! I can get in-touch just
          find, in fact technology allows me to get in touch with anyone,
          anytime I want–even at three am when I’m deathly alone with no one to
          talk to. I feel I don’t need to get to know myself when I can get to
          know everyone else and possibly even lose my personality with it
          because I’m so focused on other people and my amazing technology. I
          hope you can relate; I never even leave home without some form of
          technology with me, I literally cannot live without it (I’ve tried and
          failed). But, there are some crazy people who don’t even have a
          smart-phone, why torture yourself. Everyone should be able to
          experience the joy I have, it’s a shame some just don’t understand.</i

            why is css important?If HTML were the engine components of a car,
            CSS would be the body style and the paint job. A website can run
            without CSS, but it certainly isn’t pretty. CSS makes the front-end
            of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without
            CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much
            harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is
            responsible for font color and more.

        <b>Difference between Border, Padding and Margin</b>
        <br />
        <i
          >Padding - The inner space between the content and the border of your
          box. <br />Border - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible
          or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured
          above. <br />
          Margin - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
